# Tendr CMS

> **Warning**
> Tendr is currently in pre-alpha stage and under active development. The code is not yet stable and should not be used for anything that matters. I am currently actively working on ... everything ... so please be aware that changes to the codebase may cause compatibility issues. Use at your own risk.

Welcome to Tendr, where content reigns supreme! Tendr's core philosophy is that creating a beautiful and functional website should always start with your content. That's why Tendr represents your content as an abstract directed graph, providing unparalleled flexibility in organizing and navigating your site. Unlike rigid hierarchies or opinionated site structures found in other CMSs, Tendr allows the hierarchy of your site to include pages with multiple parents, pages with no parents, or even in loops.

In fact, Tendr's approach to content organization is even more flexible than hand-coded HTML sites of yore, freeing you from the constraints of directory structures and enabling you to create a site that truly reflects your unique vision. Tendr is perfect for old-school internet hipsters who want to hand-craft their sites like a beautiful garden.
