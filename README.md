# Tendr CMS

> **Warning**

I am currently actively working on ... everything ... so please be aware that changes to the codebase may cause compatibility issues. Use at your own risk.

Welcome to Tendr, where content reigns supreme! Tendr's core philosophy is that creating a beautiful and functional website should always start with your content. That's why Tendr represents your content as an abstract directed graph, providing unparalleled flexibility in organizing and navigating your site. Unlike rigid hierarchies or opinionated site structures found in other CMSs, Tendr allows the hierarchy of your site to include pages with multiple parents, pages with no parents, or even in loops.

In fact, Tendr's approach to content organization is even more flexible than hand-coded HTML sites of yore, freeing you from the constraints of directory structures and enabling you to create a site that truly reflects your unique vision. Tendr is perfect for old-school internet hipsters who want to hand-craft their sites like a beautiful garden.

With Tendr, you can focus on creating great content first, and then worry about organizing it later. No more struggling to fit your ideas into predefined structures or worrying about breaking links when you move pages around. Tendr lets you write content in a way that feels natural, while still giving you the tools to organize and navigate it in any way you see fit. Say goodbye to the limitations of traditional CMSs and hello to the freedom and creativity of Tendr.
